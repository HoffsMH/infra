#   - encrypts that tar file and shreds original tar file
#   - puts that encrypted tar file in a iso date named folder in ~/.trash
#   - puts a shell script that restores the file to its original location if you have gpg unlock
#     - doesn't even attempt to restore if there is a file or folder in the restore files place
